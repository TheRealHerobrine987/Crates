I am very good at making crates using plugins like ExcellentCrates, CrazyCrates, and others. I know how to set up crates with custom rewards, chances, and animations to make each opening feel exciting. I don’t just use the basic setup— I add my own style and creativity to make crates that stand out. Whether it’s unique items, themed designs, or fun effects, I make each crate special and memorable. I make sure every crate fits the server’s style and gives players a rewarding experience.
